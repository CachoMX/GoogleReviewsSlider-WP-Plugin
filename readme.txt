== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Google API key? =

Yes, you need a Google Places API key for the initial setup and place search. The plugin provides instructions on how to get one for free.

= What is Outscraper and do I need an API key for it? =

Outscraper is a service that allows extraction of more Google reviews. The plugin comes with a pre-configured API token, so you don't need to set up your own unless you want to use your personal account.

You can extract between 10 to 500 reviews per location. The default Google API only provides 5 reviews, but with Outscraper integration, you can get much more.

Reviews are stored in your database permanently. You can manually extract new reviews anytime using the "Extract Reviews" button in the admin panel.

Yes! With the ability to extract up to 500 reviews, you can filter to show only 5-star reviews and still have plenty to display in your slider.

== Changelog ==

= 2.7.11 =
* CRITICAL FIX: Self-healing database tables. If the `grs_reviews` table is missing, it is now recreated automatically on the next page load instead of falling into a "Table doesn't exist" loop on every request.
* CRITICAL FIX: Circuit breaker on the front-end reviews fetch. The plugin now attempts an external API fetch at most once every 15 minutes per place, even on failure, preventing PHP worker exhaustion and server-wide overload when the table or upstream API is unavailable.
* Corrected the plugin version number, which had been stuck at 2.7.8 across releases.
