# Mobile Carousel Adjustments

The reviews slider now autoplays, includes navigation arrows, and supports "Read more" expansion on smaller screens.

## Adjusting Behaviour
- **Autoplay & speed:** modify the `autoplay` and `autoplay_speed` shortcode attributes or data attributes in the slider markup.
- **Slides per view:** use `slides_desktop`, `slides_tablet`, and `slides_mobile` shortcode attributes.
- **Styling:** front-end styles are in `css/grs-direct.css` and JavaScript logic in `js/script.js`.

Focus states and ARIA labels have been added to maintain accessibility.
